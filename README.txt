Edirol-MIDI-Tally-Interface
www.dargs.com.au

This is my first attempt at quite a few things, Eagle, PCB fab, Git-hub posting!

Posting the code because a few people have asked for it, however this project has been sidelined, as I don't have the edirol mixer for testing anymore. 

The PCBs had a few mistakes, and I haven't fixed them in the Eagle files, it was over a year ago when I made them, can't quite remember what was wrong with them, but they were major mistakes. 

Best advice, use the references, http://timothytwillman.com, arduino.cc and sparkfun.com etc
